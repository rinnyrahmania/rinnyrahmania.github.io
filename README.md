# This is my personal page that the themes customized from Robert Michel's

I would like to share some of my research activities through git. I've been observing many examples before making my own github page. By far, Michell's theme suits my purpose. Highly appreciate for sharing this great work.

## Theming

I'm still learning how to work with quarto to develop a website and blog. So if you wish to learn about more settings and configuration for this theme, please check the following resources:

1. Quarto documentation page (https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)
2. Robert Michell's website (https://robertmitchellv.com/) and his repository (https://github.com/robertmitchellv/robertmitchellv.github.io)

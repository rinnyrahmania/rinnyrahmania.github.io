# This is my personal page that the themes customized from Robert Michel's

I've been observing many examples before making my own github page. By far, Michell's theme suits my purpose. 
Highly appreciate for showcasing this great work.

## Organization

This page has three main sections:

-   `blog`
-   `projects`
-   `lesson`

<br>

Each has it's own landing page and `_metadata.yml` file. Additionally the `ejs` directory contains a small custom listing template for the main landing page.

I agree with Michell's idea that some older blog posts should not be rendered; rather, they're sort of put together with images and text. 

Lessons and projects use an `<iframe>` to source the `html` file in with an option to make it full screen, which I thought was a neat idea.
